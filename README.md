#  Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
### Predicting the likelihood of diseases from patient medical data

---

## Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have a disease based on clinical data.  
The model helps in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare decisions.

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at https://www.codealpha.tech/index.html**.

##  Dataset
Used public medical datasets like:
- Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle)

Each record includes patient attributes like:
- Age, Gender, Blood Pressure  

---

##  Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Feature Scaling  
3. Model Training using:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

---

##  Results
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (~98.4%)  
- The model effectively predicts disease likelihood with strong generalization.
